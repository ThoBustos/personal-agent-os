# Daily Review Playbook

A quick check-in to ensure you're living as the person you're becoming.

## When

- **Morning:** Set intentions (5-10 min)
- **Evening:** Quick reflection (5 min)

---

## Morning: Set the Day

### 1. Energy Check
Rate your energy (1-10). This informs what's realistic today.

### 2. Top 3 Priorities
What are the three most important things to accomplish today?

Ask yourself:
- What would make today a success?
- What's been on my list too long?
- What moves the keystone focus forward?

### 3. Pillar Touch
Quickly scan the daily compass:
- [ ] **Body** - How will I move today?
- [ ] **Create** - What will I make?
- [ ] **Truth** - What conversation do I need to have?
- [ ] **Connect** - Who will I be present with?
- [ ] **Awe** - What might inspire wonder?

### 4. One Intention
Set one intention for *how* you want to be today (not what you'll do).

Example: "I will be patient in conversations" or "I will protect my deep work time"

## Evening: Quick Reflection

### 1. Gratitude
Write one thing you're grateful for. Be specific.

Not: "My family"
Yes: "The way Sarah laughed at dinner tonight"

### 2. Did I...?
Quick check:
- [ ] Move my body
- [ ] Create something
- [ ] Tell the truth
- [ ] Connect with someone
- [ ] Feel awe or gratitude

### 3. Tomorrow's Top Priority
What's the one thing for tomorrow? Write it down so you wake up with direction.

## Tips

### Keep It Short
This should take 10-15 minutes total. If it takes longer, you're overcomplicating it.

### Don't Skip
Consistency beats intensity. A 2-minute check-in beats skipping entirely.

### Link to Weekly
Your daily priorities should connect to your weekly keystone focus.

### Use Your Weekly Doc
Write daily entries in your weekly document (`02_JOURNAL/Weekly/YYYY-W##.md`).

## The Daily Compass

```
Did I move my body?        → Body
Did I create something?    → Creation
Did I tell the truth?      → Mind/Relationships
Did I connect with someone?→ Relationships
Did I feel awe or gratitude?→ Spirit
```

If you hit 4/5 most days, you're doing well.

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-planning
Don't turn this into project management. Three priorities max.

### Guilt-tripping
If you miss a day, just start again. No judgment.

### Optimization obsession
This is about presence, not perfection.
