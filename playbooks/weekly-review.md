# Weekly Review Playbook

A structured process for reflecting on the past week and setting intentions for the next.

## When

**Sunday evening or Monday morning** - Pick one and be consistent.

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Part 1: Review Last Week (15 min)

### 1. Scan Your Week

Open last week's document (`02_JOURNAL/Weekly/YYYY-W##.md`).

Look at:
- Daily entries
- Completed tasks
- Unfinished items
- Notes and gratitude entries

### 2. What Went Well?

List 3-5 wins. Include:
- Tasks completed
- Moments of presence
- Connections made
- Insights gained

### 3. What Didn't Go Well?

Be honest:
- What did you avoid?
- What took longer than expected?
- Where did you lose energy?
- What remained undone?

### 4. Pillar Scores

Rate each pillar (1-10):
- Body
- Spirit
- Mind
- Relationships
- Joy
- Creation
- Wealth
- Impact
- Media
- Exploration

Notice which ones are low. They need attention next week.

## Part 2: Plan Next Week (15-20 min)

### 1. Create New Weekly Doc

Create `02_JOURNAL/Weekly/YYYY-W##.md` using the template.

### 2. Keystone Focus

Ask: **If only one thing worked this week, what would matter most?**

This is your north star for the week. Everything else supports this.

### 3. Pillar Intentions

For each foundational pillar, set a simple intention:

| Pillar | Intention | Metric |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Body | | |
| Creation | | |
| Relationships | | |
| Clarity | | |
| Spirit | | |

Keep it simple. "3 workouts" not "Perfect nutrition every day."

### 4. One Brave Act

What uncomfortable thing will you do this week?

Growth requires discomfort. Name one specific act of courage.

### 5. One Joy Anchor

What will you do purely for aliveness?

Not productive. Not useful. Just alive.

### 6. One System Upgrade

What will make future weeks easier?

A template? A automation? A delegation? A simplification?

### 7. Project Check

Scan your active projects (`03_PROJECTS/`):
- Update `_STATE.md` if needed
- Move items from backlog to this week
- Note any blockers

---

## Part 3: Prepare (5 min)

### Calendar Scan

Look at your calendar for the week:
- What's fixed?
- Where's your deep work time?
- Any conflicts with your intentions?

### Energy Mapping

When are you:
- Sharpest? → Schedule creation
- Social? → Schedule meetings
- Low energy? → Schedule admin

## Tips

### Protect the Time
Block this on your calendar. It's not optional.

### Don't Over-Plan
Leave slack. Life happens. 70% planned is about right.

### Connect to Month
Your weekly keystone should serve your monthly goals.

### Review Project States
Stale `_STATE.md` files lead to confusion. Keep them current.

## Common Pitfalls

### Planning Too Much
If you can't fit it on one page, it's too much.

### Skipping the Reflection
The review is as important as the planning. Don't skip it.

### Ignoring Low-Scoring Pillars
If a pillar scores low multiple weeks, something needs to change.

### Forgetting Joy
Productivity without aliveness leads to burnout.
