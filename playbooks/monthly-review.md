## The 8 Reflection Sections

### 1. Identity Calibration (10 min)

**Core question:** Who did I become this month?

This is not about what you did. It's about who you became.

Ask:
- What did I learn about myself?
- What patterns did I break?
- What traits became more reliable?
- What traits weakened?
- Where did I surprise myself?
- Where did I disappoint myself?

Write freely. Don't judge.

### 2. Energy Audit (10 min)

**Core question:** What gave and drained energy?

Create two lists:

**Gave Energy:**
- People who energized you
- Activities that filled you up
- Places that felt alive
- Work that flowed

**Drained Energy:**
- People who depleted you
- Activities that felt heavy
- Places that felt dead
- Work that was a slog

Then ask the hard question:
**Why am I still doing what drains me?**

Be honest. The answer often reveals something important.

### 3. Truth Inventory (10 min)

**Core question:** Where did I lie to myself?

This requires courage.

Ask:
- What am I avoiding?
- What conversation am I postponing?
- What decision am I delaying?
- Where am I being comfortable instead of honest?

Examples:
- Pretending something matters when it doesn't
- Staying in situations that don't serve you
- Avoiding difficult conversations
- Saying yes when you mean no

### 4. Relationship Scan (10 min)

**Core question:** How are my relationships evolving?

Ask:
- Who felt closer this month?
- Who drifted?
- Who do I miss?
- Who do I avoid?
- Where do I need courage?
- Who needs appreciation?

Relationships don't decay suddenly. They decay silently. Notice early.

### 5. Creation Review (10 min)

**Core question:** What did I create?

List everything you created (not consumed):
- Work shipped
- Content published
- Systems built
- Ideas developed
- Conversations facilitated

Then ask:
- Did I work on the important or the urgent?
- What's the ratio of creation to consumption?
- What should I stop creating?

### 6. Leverage Check (10 min)

**Core question:** Is my life becoming more scalable?

Ask:
- Did I build systems or just expend effort?
- Did I delegate anything?
- Did I document anything?
- Did I automate anything?
- Did I simplify anything?

If you're working harder every month for similar results, something is wrong.

### 7. Fear & Edge Detection (10 min)

**Core question:** Where did I avoid growth?

Growth always feels like friction. Notice where you pulled back.

Ask:
- What scared me this month?
- What risk did I dodge?
- What conversation did I avoid?
- What decision did I postpone?
- What would my higher self have done?

### 8. Wonder Scan (5 min)

**Core question:** What gave me awe?

If this section is empty, something is wrong.

Ask:
- What made me feel small (in a good way)?
- When did I feel fully alive?
- What inspired wonder?
- What was beautiful?

Wonder is fuel. Without it, you're just surviving.

## Tips

### Protect the Time
This is a 60-90 minute appointment with yourself. Honor it.

### Be Honest
Self-deception is the enemy of growth. Write the truth.

### Notice Resistance
If a section feels hard to write, pay attention. Resistance often points to truth.

### Connect to Vision
Periodically re-read `LIFE_VISION.md`. Are you still aligned?

### Archive if Needed
If significant changes happened, update archive files (`LIFE_VISION_ARCHIVE.md`, `GLOBAL_STATE_ARCHIVE.md`).
