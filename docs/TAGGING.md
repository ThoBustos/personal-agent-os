# Tagging System

Tags create relations across all entities for pattern identification and quick retrieval.

## Philosophy

Tags serve three purposes:
1. **Cross-reference** - Connect related content across folders
2. **Pattern identification** - Notice recurring themes
3. **Quick retrieval** - Find specific types of content

## Tag Categories

### Entity Types

Mark what kind of content this is:

```
#person      - A person note
#project     - A project reference
#decision    - A decision made
#idea        - An idea to explore
#memory      - A significant moment
#gratitude   - Something you're grateful for
```

### Pillars

Connect content to life pillars:

```
#pillar/body          - Body & Energy
#pillar/spirit        - Spirit & Meaning
#pillar/mind          - Mind & Clarity
#pillar/relationships - Love & Relationships
#pillar/joy           - Self-Time & Joy
#pillar/creation      - Creation & Craft
#pillar/wealth        - Wealth & Leverage
#pillar/impact        - Impact & Service
#pillar/media         - Media & Personal Brand
#pillar/exploration   - Exploration & Adventure
```

### Projects

Tag content related to specific projects:

```
#project/project-name
```

Examples:
```
#project/startup
#project/book
#project/podcast
```

### Patterns (Emergent)

Add these as you notice recurring themes:

```
#pattern/energy-drain    - Things that drain energy
#pattern/flow-state      - When you hit flow
#pattern/growth-edge     - Growth opportunities
#pattern/resistance      - Where you resist
#pattern/insight         - Key insights
```

### Status

Mark the state of content:

```
#active    - Currently active/relevant
#someday   - Might do later
#archived  - No longer active
```

### Time References

For temporal context:

```
#weekly    - Weekly-related
#monthly   - Monthly-related
#quarterly - Quarterly-related
#yearly    - Yearly-related
```

## Usage Examples

### Connecting Decisions to Projects and Pillars

```markdown
# Decision: Hire a contractor

Decided to hire a contractor for the backend work.

**Why:** Need to ship faster, my time is better spent on product.

#decision #project/startup #pillar/wealth #pillar/creation
```

### Tagging Gratitude

```markdown
### Gratitude
Had an amazing dinner with the team. Felt connected and energized.
#gratitude #pillar/relationships #memory
```

### Finding Patterns

Search for `#pattern/energy-drain` to see all the things that drain your energy, then make changes.

### Project-Pillar Connections

Search `#project/podcast #pillar/media` to find all podcast-related media pillar work.

---

## Search Patterns

Common searches you might do:

| Search | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `#decision #project/startup` | All decisions for a project |
| `#gratitude` | All gratitude entries |
| `#pattern/energy-drain` | What drains energy |
| `#pillar/body` | All body/health related content |
| `#idea #pillar/creation` | Creative ideas |
| `#person #project/startup` | People involved in a project |

---

## Best Practices

### Be Consistent
Use the same tag format everywhere. `#project/startup` not sometimes `#startup`.

### Start Small
Begin with entity types and pillars. Add pattern tags as you notice them.

### Review Tags
During monthly reflection, review your tags. Notice patterns. Adjust as needed.

### Don't Over-Tag
2-5 tags per entry is usually enough. More than that reduces signal.

---

## Tag Index

Keep a running list of your tags for reference. Add new ones here as you create them.

### Active Tags
