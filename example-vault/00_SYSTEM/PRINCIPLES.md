# Operating Principles

Core frameworks and principles that guide decision-making.

---

## Core Framework

### Systems > Goals
Build processes that make success inevitable rather than chasing individual targets.

### Principles > Tactics
Tactics change with context. Principles remain. Understand the why; invent the how.

### Writing > Reading
Reading is input. Writing is processing. Writing forces clarity and creates compounding value.

### Questions > Answers
Good questions open doors. Answers close them. Stay curious longer than comfortable.

### People > Projects
Projects end. Relationships compound. Invest in people more than outcomes.

## Decision Filters

When facing a choice:

1. Does this align with my end-game identity?
2. Which pillar does this serve?
3. Is this a system or a one-time effort?
4. Will I be proud of this decision in 10 years?
