## The Pipeline

Daily writing feeds your content pipeline:

```
Daily/          → capture raw ideas, practice
    ↓
Ideas/          → seeds worth developing
    ↓
Drafts/         → active work in progress
    ↓
Published/      → shipped work
```

## Subfolders

### Daily/
Daily writing practice - stream of consciousness, prompts, raw capture.

**Purpose:** Build the writing muscle, capture ideas fresh
**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
**Philosophy:** Practice, not publication. No pressure, no editing.

### Reflections/
Personal writing not meant for publication. Deeper thinking pieces.

### Drafts/
Work in progress content being shaped for publication.

Include origin tracking:
```yaml
---
origin: Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md
status: draft | editing | ready
target: Substack | X thread | Newsletter
---
```

### Published/
Archive of shipped work.

### Ideas/
Seeds for future content - one-liners, hooks, questions.

## Philosophy

> **Writing > Reading** - Writing is processing. It forces clarity.

> **Creation > Consumption** - Create more than you consume.

> **Daily practice** - Writers write every day. The muscle develops through use.

## Workflow

1. **Daily** - Write in `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Spark** - Notice something worth developing
3. **Draft** - Create `Drafts/piece-name.md`, reference origin
4. **Edit** - Iterate, get feedback
5. **Publish** - Ship it, move to `Published/`
